# qMTLab

********** qMTLab at ISMRM 2016 in Singapore **********
If you are lucky enough to be at the ISMRM 24th annual meeting, which will take place in Singapore 07-13 May 2016, come see our presentation about qMTLab during the poster session:

Session: A Mixed Bag: Sequence Simulations & Analyses / Dynamic Imaging
Computer No.: 36
Time: 10:00
Date: Tuesday, May 10, 2016

Hope to see you there!

Until then, expect some significant changes in the software, as we will be updating it regularly. Keep an eye on the repository to get the news about new and improved features.


qMTlab is a powerful, open source, scalable, easy to use and intuitive software for qMT data simulation, fitting and analysis. The software consists of two parts:
1) a qMT data simulator
2) a qMT data fitting and visualization interface

The simulation part allows end users to easily simulate qMT data using the above described methods, evaluate how well these models perform under known parameters input, determine the most appropriate acquisition protocol and evaluate how fitting constraints impact the results. The data fitting part provides a simple interface to import real-world qMT data, fit them using the selected fitting procedure, and visualize the resulting parameters maps.

Please report any bug or suggestions in [github](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab/issues).
