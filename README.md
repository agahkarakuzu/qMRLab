**qMRLab is an open-source software for quantitative MR image analysis.** The main goal
is to provide the community with an intuitive tool for **data fitting**, **plotting**, **simulation** and **protocol optimization** for a myriad of different quantitative models.
The modularity of the implementation makes it easy to add any additional modules and we encourage everyone to contribute their favorite recipe for qMR!

For **documentation**, visit the [Documentation website](http://qmrlab.readthedocs.io/)

If you are a **developer**, visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab/wiki). 

Please report any **bug** or **suggestions** in [GitHub](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab/issues).

qMRLab is a fork from the initial project [qMTLab](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab).
