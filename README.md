# qMTLab

******* qMTLab at ISMRM 2016 in Singapore *******
Thanks to everyone who came to see my e-poster at ISMRM!
For those of you who couldn't be there, I added me presentation in the root directory of qMTLab. Be sure to check it out in presentation mode to view all the videos in there. They're sure to come in handy to give you an nice overview of all the things you can do with qMTLab!
*************************************************


qMTlab is a powerful, open source, scalable, easy to use and intuitive software for qMT data simulation, fitting and analysis. The software consists of two parts:
1) a qMT data simulator
2) a qMT data fitting and visualization interface

The simulation part allows end users to easily simulate qMT data using the above described methods, evaluate how well these models perform under known parameters input, determine the most appropriate acquisition protocol and evaluate how fitting constraints impact the results. The data fitting part provides a simple interface to import real-world qMT data, fit them using the selected fitting procedure, and visualize the resulting parameters maps.
